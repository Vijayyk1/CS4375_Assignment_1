Also ensure that you have downloaded NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Pandas to be able to run the program. After all of the libraries are downloaded, you can just run the 'gradient_descent' file and it should output the various evaluation statistics of the Car Evaluation dataset found below. The preset data learning step and number of iterations is set to the most optimal but could be changed to see how the evaluation statistics change.
